## Python security tools
This repository contains multiple python security tools that can be used for all sorts of testing. Such as the following:
- Detecting open ports with HTTP(S) service running on it

-> Including taking screenshots of these pages

### Installation
Before running the python script makes sure to install the requirements file by running the following command:
- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

-> I recommend making a virtual environment in python and installing the dependencies there
